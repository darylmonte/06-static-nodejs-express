# Static Node.js and Express Site

My sixth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree. I created a portfolio site showcasing all the projects I built.

## Personalization
I have customized the colors of the background, text, links and navigation section and using a different font to match the retro feel I was aiming for.

I have added an effect to the thumbnails of the index page when hovering. The thumbanail grows by 10% when you hover on it.

I have created a custom page for 404 and any other errors that a user might encounter when visiting the page.
